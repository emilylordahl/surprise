During my time as an instructor for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, every Friday I presented my students with an exit ticket survey  to receive feedback on how the class was going. The ticket always ended with a question asking students to give a shoutout to one of his or her classmates.

Using that question, I aggregated the responses and built an unnecessarily complex application to practice using  Sinatra, CSS keyframes, JavaScript and jQuery. I presented the application on graduation day to highlight each student's hard work, as well as some of my favorite responses that I received over the 12-week course.
