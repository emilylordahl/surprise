During my time as an instructor for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive , every Friday I presented my students with exit tickets to receive feedback on how class was going. The ticket always ended with a question asking students to give a shoutout to one of his or her fellow classmates.

Using that question, I built an unnecessarily complex application to practice using  Sinatra, CSS animations, JavaScript and jQuery. I presented the application to my students on their graduation day to highlight each student's hard work, as well as some of my favorite responses that I received over the 12-week course.
